THANKS
Hi! Thanks for downloading this resourcepack! I still have a lot of textures to do, if you would like to help me,
send me a pm on planetminecraft and we can discuss it from there.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD TO MINECRAFT
Drag "David's Details" to your resourcepack folder, the folder can be found by opening minecraft,
press options, resourcepack..., open resourcepack folder and then drag the file into that folder.

LEGAL STUFF
You can modify this resourcepack for private use but you cannot publish it to the public.
You can use this on your youtube videos.

Enjoy!
